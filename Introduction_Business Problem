Every year thousands of student flock in Germany to start their higher education, be it Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD program. 
Germany is home to some of the biggest cities in the world, and each one has its own story to tell. Cities all over Germany are 
perfect for students and can offer them a great life beyond studies. However, what students face in their initial days of arrival 
in Germany is finding the perfect accommodation. There are a huge number of aspirants joining numerous courses in various institutes, 
however not many student-dorms or hostels to accommodate them all. Unknown of this fact, after arrival, students spend more time
searching for accommodation than focusing on other activities. The accommodation in Germany, especially for international students,
is really a huge problem. I, being one of the victims, have tried to analyze the scenario of student-dorm in my current city, Munich.
Data that might contribute to this analysis includes the number of student-dorms available across the city, their location, their 
basic rent including overheads, and the waiting time for their availability. This project aims to analyze the available data and produce
a suitable report for the prospective students desiring to pursue their studies in Munich, Germany.
