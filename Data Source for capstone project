Most of the relevant data related with the student-dorms in Munich can be obtained from here, I have already scraped the data and
uploaded it into GitHub repository as .csv file as available through the link above.I have also used Foursquare location data to
cluster and segment the dorm locations.

Every prospective students who would be interested to pursue their studies in Munich, as well as those who have already arrived but have
yet not found an accommodation, would find this analysis helpful.
